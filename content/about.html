about me
========              

I'm currently a Ph.D. Candidate in Rhetoric and Composition at Purdue University.  I received my MA in English at the University of Arkansas, and my undergraduate degrees in English and Spanish from Freed-Hardeman University.  

Originally from West Tennessee, I'm currently living in West Lafayette, IN.
