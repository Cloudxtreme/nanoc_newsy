about me
========              

I'm currently a Ph.D. Candidate in Rhetoric and Composition at Purdue University.  I received my M.A. in English at the University of Arkansas, and my undergraduate degrees in English and Spanish from Freed-Hardeman University.    

I am originally from West Tennessee--for those of you who aren't from the Tennessee area, that is a meaningful term culturally, legally, and geographically. I'm currently living in West Lafayette, Indiana while attending Purdue.  My spare time, when it exists, is devoted things like inventing and baking pizzas, gaming, reading comics (Batman, Hellboy/BPRD, and Superman mostly) and other pursuits too numerous to list here.
