my research 
================

I have several research interests in the larger field of Rhetoric and Composition. Below you'll find a sampling of topics I've previously researched or currently am researching:

*  The application of technology to the writing classroom on the programmatic level  

*  The historical shift from rhetoric to composition in the classrooms of small colleges at the start of 20th century  

*  The way our fields define themselves within a university's official documents such as course catalog listings and course descriptions                                                                                     

*  Online communication and the creation and use of ethos in anonymous online environments
