my research 
================

I have several research interests in the larger field of Rhetoric and Composition. Below you'll find a sampling of topics I've previously researched or currently am researching:

*  The way that content management systems affect how we teach
*  The development of content management systems for writing classrooms
*  The application of technology to Rhetoric and Composition on the programmatic level
*  The historical development of composition pedagogy and curriculum in small colleges at the start of 20th century
*  The way our field defines itself within a university's official documents such as course catalog listings and course descriptions
*  Online communication and the creation and use of ethos in anonymous online environments
