about this site
==================

This site was created using the static html-site generator <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/">nanoc</a>.  Written in Ruby, nanoc allows for traditional CSS and HTML-based site design while automating some of the more tedious aspects of maintaining more than a handful of static HTML pages.  Representing a middle point between totally hand-coded HTML and a more robust content management system such as Drupal or Wordpress, nanoc is an exciting tool for rhetoricians interested in web design because it allows much of the content-creating freedom of a CMS while providing the total control and server-friendly lightness of traditional HTML-coded sites.  

For those interested, this site makes use of Google Web Fonts, a flexible way of integrating more varied fonts using the Web Font API and a little bit of CSS code.  More information can be found <a href='http://www.google.com/webfonts'>here</a>.  Additionally, this theme is responsively designed, meaning that it will scale with the size of the screen viewing it.
