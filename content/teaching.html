<h2>teaching philosophy</h2>
<p><strong>introduction</strong><br />
My teaching philosophy represents my current position as an educator and composition researcher, and I expect it to continue to evolve as my work and teaching do. However, my work in the classroom rests on a foundation of reflection that supports the pillars of my teaching—audience awareness, design and ethos, and a production focus. Reflection drives classroom instruction, and is key to my approach to teaching. In my classroom I teach students the rhetorical underpinnings of audience awareness, design, and then translate that theory into production, but good end products don’t necessarily indicate mastery of theory, that evidences lies in their reflective understandings. This reflection is the foundation of my classroom, with everything else being built on top of it.</p>

<p><strong>audience awareness</strong><br />
Audience awareness forms one pillar of my classroom instruction. Students come into the college classroom, more often than not, with vague notions audience and the importance that audience plays in both academic as well as professional work. I usually start my discussion of audience with students by focusing on audience they are familiar with the most--themselves. For example, in my Introductory Composition courses I have students bring to class hallway signs and posters that “stand out” to them, and we analyze why those posters work so well. Then, we rework university safety posters to make them more appealing to the students who pass them in the halls everyday, with a focus on understanding the rhetorical situation of the local college hallway bulletin board and what it takes for a college student to notice something amongst the piles of flyers and posters. This audience awareness forms the core of my classroom teaching, helping to inform students from the start to end of a project just who they are writing to and what they need to do to relate to that audience.</p>

<p><strong>design and ethos</strong><br />
Design stands as another pillar of my classroom strategy. In an increasingly online world of publication, plain black and white documents and poor design don’t stand up to reader scrutiny and often devastate ethos (I define ethos as the credibility, trustworthiness, and general reputation). In my classroom I teach students to understand the role that good design can play in creating ethos with readers, and the destructive potential of poor design to their professional and academic ethos and reputation. As part of my pedagogy I introduce students to professional document design software such as Adobe InDesign and the rhetorical principles they need to use it properly to create well-designed documents in the classroom and the workplace. For instance, my students in Technical Writing regularly design and draft user manuals and guides as part of the curriculum, with topics varying from landing a Cirrus to creating a guide for small business owners securing their local network and blocking productivity-wasting sites such as Reddit and Facebook. In each of these assignments, I make design one of the central focuses--reminding students that without the ethos provided by competent design their hard work may go entirely unnoticed.</p>

<p><strong>production focus</strong><br />
A production-heavy focus supports my class as a third pillar of my instructional goals. Rhetorical theory and classroom lectures can only go so far in teaching students about subjects such as design. Without putting the ideas we discuss in class to work, subjects like design can be hard to translate into usable skills. Because of this, my classrooms center around production--after the theoretical foundation has been lain down for the work. By allowing students to work in class, I’m able to troubleshoot issues that arise, and turn problems with design or production into teachable moments where I can show students how the concepts that we’ve been discussing in class come into play in the creation of the documents assigned to them. For example, in a course on Writing for Content Management Systems that took place over a one-month short course, I devoted half of any given class period to learning the theory behind site building, the specifics of using a new module within a specific rhetorical context, and student presentations on modules. The rest of the class was devoted to students working in groups to create custom content management systems for university clients, allowing me to intercede when needed to give help, feedback, and help students connect the theory we'd been discussing to the production they were currently working on. I find this production-intensive class environment lets me help students make rhetorically savvy decisions that make responsible use of their time and resources and helps them internalize through practice the theory and terms we’ve built our assignment on.</p>

<p><strong>reflective foundation</strong><br />
Reflection is the foundation of my teaching philosophy, so as a component of my classes, students must demonstrate their understanding of the principles behind each assignment by explaining the rhetorical moves they’ve made in documents and why they think these moves would be effective. My focus in these reflections centers on proper understanding and deployment of the theoretical terms our work relies on. If my students can’t tell me why a document they have created is successful, they may have created a good end product, but they’ve not built the rhetorical foundations they need to succeed in future work. My goal is for them to be able to do both--to create good documents and to understand why they’ve been successful. If a student can’t create a document and know why its successful, then I feel my work in the classroom hasn’t been successful.</p>
