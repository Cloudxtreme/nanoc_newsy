<p><strong>introduction</strong><br />
How do we create position ourselves educators in a Web 2.0 world? In a world of Twitter, Facebook, Google+, Youtube, Pintrest, Reddit, and others, how do we define writing? How do we position ourselves as content creators? The answer to this question often falls back to an uncomfortable default: we teach students how to write using the software that is currently popular online. In an age of Myspace we teach Myspace writing; in an age of Twitter we teach tweeting. With each new technology we insert ourselves into the milieu, positioning ourselves as the sage writing instructors who can understand and adapt to composition in whatever new tool thrown our way. We often adapt our writing and teaching to the needs of the new software we have to use (today’s lesson: learning to compress a thought into 140 characters), but not often enough do we think about the types of software we’d like to use and teach with.  We're far too often content to stick with tools provided by others, even when they can be detrimental to our writing classes.  We don't seem to be heeding the warning of Paul LeBlanc that “we need to pay much closer attention to, and assert our role in, the development of and widespread adoption of the microcomputer as the primary tool for writing the next millennium.  Doing so allows us and our students to be users of technology rather than its victims” (LeBlanc, 1993).  Instead of taking that active role, far too often we take on the role of passive users of new technology—creating an opening for instructive institutional courseware and flavor-of-the-month online social media platforms to dictate our field's software usage.  But, that doesn’t have to be the case—we can and should be in greater control of the software we teach with and through.</p>    

<p>Open-source CMSs such as Wordpress, Drupal, and Joomla offer educators in English the chance to craft their own electronic course spaces, but have not been the subject of much serious study in the field for their teaching application (though some have looked at them as a tool for departmental- level information management (Cripps 2011)). My dissertation tackles the subject of open-source CMS solutions and the ways that instructors can use them to create custom learning environments by combining the existing body of work in Computers and Writing on computer-mediated communication with my three years of experience developing, implementing, supporting, and maintaining a custom open-source CMS for Purdue University's Professional Writing program. Combining my experience creating a custom writing environment for the Purdue program with existing scholarship, I investigate the benefits of making the move to open-source CMSs for classroom use as well as the challenges that await us as we move from monday morning quarterbacking the CMS situation in our classrooms to taking an active role in shaping their development.</p>         

<p><strong>chapter one</strong><br />
In my first chapter, I trace the history of Computers and Writing and the application of computers to the writing classroom, with an eye specifically towards the role that instructor-created software has played in the field from the early days of the Apple II to more modern applications such as the web- based peer revision tool Eli (2011). I finish the discussion by looking into the various ways that we have attempted to meet the onslaught of the Internet in classrooms and the nearly unavoidable demands of teaching in a Web 2.0 world by comparing the near-constant drive of many in Computer and Writing to try newer and better tools from the wider tech world with the movement by others to take a stand as teacher-programmers, creating our own tools instead of relying on the WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) tools of others.</p>

<p><strong>chapter two</strong><br />
In chapter two, I look more closely at the idea of the teacher-programmer and advocate for another option for those in the field that do not wish to go through the process of learning and mastering the various programming languages of the web—embracing open-source content management systems such as Drupal and Wordpress. I develop the discussion by looking at the multiple advantages that instructors can gain from going with open-source CMS solutions (while at the same time avoiding the time-consuming process of learning to program). I argue that open-source solutions allow instructors to create a custom classroom space online with a modest learning curve, adjust their classroom dynamics by switching in and out different methods of submitting and discussing assignments, learn the in's and out's of database-driven web design, pick up through practice the skill of developing useful web interfaces, and collaborate and share resources through a shared foundational base CMS.</p>

<p><strong>chapter three</strong><br />
In my third chapter, I look into the benefits of adopting an open-source CMS on the programmatic level, specifically focusing on the benefits that programs and administrators can gain from implementing a custom solution to fit the needs of their departments. I focus first on the fundamental shift in power that a departmentally-created CMS creates in the movement away from institutional solutions such as Blackboard, allowing program heads to create specific interpretations of the CMS that help meet the pedagogical and technological goals they have for specific courses. Next, I look at different ways that programs can use open-source CMSs to create an environment of collaboration and innovation in the online teaching space, while at the same time keeping the standards they've established on a programmatic level. Finally I focus on how taking on the project of a custom-CMS has the potential to build bonds between faculty of varying specialities and disciplines by giving them a shared teaching tool that they can collaborate on and share ideas about.</p>       

<p><strong>chapter four</strong><br />
Chapter four takes a more focused look a the benefits of a custom CMS by looking in depth at the how two radically different writing environments can be fostered by simple switching out two different modules that control how students draft and revise their assignments. Backed by original research, I look at the impact that the Workflow and Workbench modules have on the dynamics between student writers. The modules create different environments by altering the relationship that reviewers and authors have between draft and finished product. I use the Workflow module to set up a traditional writing workflow in which an author is able to mark a piece into “Drafting,” “Review Requested,” or“Submitted.” While other students are able to give comments in the“Review Requested phase, the author has final control over the submission. The Workbench module takes a much different approach, allowing students to be assigned into revision teams in which it is the reviewers instead of the author that makes the final decision over whether a piece is able to move from drafting to being submitted. Comparing these two, I highlight how the modularity of open- source CMSs makes this type of dramatic shift in the online writing environment possible, opening up a cornucopia of possibilities for experimentation in online instruction.</p> 

<p><strong>chapter five</strong><br />
I close my dissertation by looking at the implications that open-source content management systems have for Computers and Writing as well as the wider world of English studies. This work is important because while we deal with course management systems on an ever-increasing basis, too little has been done to tackle the problem of coming up with our own solutions to replace unwieldy institutional courseware. By weaving my own years of experience with the combined wisdom of three decades of Computers and Writing scholarship, I believe this research takes an important step towards defining what those custom solutions should look like, and sets the stage for a fruitful future in the area of open-source CMSs for many years to come.</p>
