Hi. I'm Adam R Pope, Ph.D. Candidate at Purdue University in Rhetoric and Composition. My areas of research and interest include rhetoric and composition, professional & technical writing, and open-source web design. I am currently entering the last year of my degree.

As the year progresses, expect to see more and more content on this site as I flesh out my online presence some more. However, for now the site is still under development, so please excuse the sparse nature of things.

If you're interested in contacting me, my information is listed below:
